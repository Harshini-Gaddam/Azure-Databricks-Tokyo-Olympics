# Tokyo Olympic Data Engineering pipeline using azure DataFactory, Databricks, Data Lake Storage, Synapse Analytics

## Introduction
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline built using **Azure Data Factory**, **Azure Data Lake Storage**, **Databricks**, and **Synapse Analytics**. 

The workflow involves:
- Extracting data from Kaggle and hosting it on GitHub.
- Loading the data into ADLS buckets using Azure Data Factory via HTTP server.
- Transforming the data using Databricks.
- Analyzing the transformed data with Synapse Analytics to derive meaningful insights.

Explore this repository to learn how these Azure services work together to enable efficient data integration, transformation, and analysis.
